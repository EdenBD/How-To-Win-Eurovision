# ### KOF Globalisation Index
# 
# #### Definition and Description:
# 
# The KOF Globalisation Index is a measure of the economic, social and political dimensions of globalisation. The higher the index score, the higher the level globalisation that country has. KOF_Globalisation_Index.xlsx contains the globalisation statistics for all countries from 1970-2016.
# 
# If a country doesn't have KOF measurements for a particular year, the cells in that row are blank (and represented as NaN in the Pandas dataframe we are making). I noticed that 13 countries (most from the former Soviet bloc countries) only had KOFGI starting at 1991 - we should discuss how to treat the missing data (more detail below).
# 
# For each year in a country, there are many different globalisation measures represented in different columns in this dataset.
# Here is the complete list:
# KOFGI	KOFGIdf	KOFGIdj	KOFEcGI	KOFEcGIdf	KOFEcGIdj	KOFTrGI	KOFTrGIdf	KOFTrGIdj	KOFFiGI	KOFFiGIdf	KOFFiGIdj	KOFSoGI	KOFSoGIdf	KOFSoGIdj	KOFIpGI	KOFIpGIdf	KOFIpGIdj	KOFInGI	KOFInGIdf	KOFInGIdj	KOFCuGI	KOFCuGIdf	KOFCuGIdj	KOFPoGI	KOFPoGIdf	KOFPoGIdj
# 
# According to the definitions in Table 1 in this paper (https://www.e-jei.org/upload/JEI_34_1_133_158_2013600183.pdf), we probably should be focusing on the 'KOFGI' (defined as "KOF overall globalization") column in KOF_Globalisation_index.xlsx as a start.

# Next,we create a filter of the 49 countries who have ever participated in Eurovision.
# 
# *Please note that former contestants Serbia and Montenegro and Yugoslavia were both dissolved and came back as separate countries, so we don't need additional entries for them  - The country "Serbia and Montenegro" became Yugoslavia, which became the 2 separate modern day countries, Serbia and Montenegro.

# #### Example of using justEurovisionCountries:
# 
# Getting the KOFGI score of Switzerland in 1989:

# In[3]:


filter = justEurovisionCountries["year"] == 1989
filter = filter & (justEurovisionCountries["country"] == "Switzerland")
switzerland1989Kofgi = justEurovisionCountries[filter]["KOFGI"]
print(switzerland1989Kofgi)


# #### Missing data 1970-1990:
# 
# A few countries, most from the former Soviet bloc, had only KOFGI scores only starting from 1991:
# 
# (Also, Lithuania and Latvia are the 2 countries who existed in 1970 but didn't have a KOGFI score in 1970 and also weren't part of the 1991-starting countries)

# In[4]:


filter1 = justEurovisionCountries["year"] == 1990
filter1 = filter1 & (pd.isna(justEurovisionCountries["KOFGI"]))
print(justEurovisionCountries[filter1]["country"])

filter1 = justEurovisionCountries["year"] == 1970
filter1 = filter1 & (pd.isna(justEurovisionCountries["KOFGI"]))
print(justEurovisionCountries[filter1]["country"])


# ## Exporting justEurovisionCountries

# In[5]:


justEurovisionCountries.to_csv(os.path.join('../data',r'KOF_globalization_modified.csv'))

# ####  I'm not sure if anything else is needed, but here is some more reformatting of the df in case it's useful:
# ============================================================================================
# 
# Next, we can reformat the dataframe so it has:
# - rows of years
# - columns of country names
# - cells are all specifically the values in the 'KOFGI' column of the original dataset

# In[6]:


pivoted_df = justEurovisionCountries[["year","country","KOFGI"]]
pivoted_df = pivoted_df.pivot(index="country",columns="year",values="KOFGI")
print("==============================================================================================")
print("Here are all the KOFGI values per year, indexed by country:\n")
print(pivoted_df)
print("==============================================================================================")


# #### Example of using pivoted_df:
# 
# (this seems harder than using justEurovisionCountries, but I'm keeping this here in case some operations might be easier with this format?
# Getting the KOFGI score of Switzerland in 1989:

# In[7]:


pivoted_df["country"] = pivoted_df.index
print (pivoted_df[pivoted_df["country"] == "Switzerland"][1989])
